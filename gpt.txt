So I am looking to take a 1 minute and 20 second and video and divide the video
into 10 parts. The video can be divded using ffmpeg 

Thanks next I need to find out the filenames on the entire directory.
is there a way to use bash scripting to read all the filenames 
and place them into a text file which could be later searched with grep?
